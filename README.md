## Project Overview
Wine quality assessment is a complex task influenced by various physicochemical properties. This project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies wines based on their quality ratings. The process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to achieve optimal classification performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several physicochemical properties of wines, including:

• Fixed Acidity

• Volatile Acidity

• Citric Acid

• Residual Sugar

• Chlorides

• Free Sulfur Dioxide

• Total Sulfur Dioxide

• Density

• pH

• Sulphates

• Alcohol

The target variable is the wine quality rating, typically on a scale from 0 to 10.

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

### Data Preprocessing:

• Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing any missing data points.

• Feature Scaling: Normalizing the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

• Class Balancing: Addressing any imbalances in the quality ratings to prevent biased predictions.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

• Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between features and the target variable.

• Visualization: Creating plots to understand data distributions and identify patterns.


### Model Selection and Training:

• Algorithm Choice: Evaluating various classification algorithms to determine the most suitable for the task.

• Cross-Validation: Implementing cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:

• Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters using grid search or random search methods to enhance performance.

### Model Evaluation:

• Performance Metrics: Assessing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

• Validation: Testing the model on unseen data to evaluate its generalization capability.

### Results interpretation and explanations :

• Theoretical explainations to understand the results

## Results
The optimized model demonstrated improved accuracy and generalization in classifying wine quality. Detailed results, including performance metrics and visualizations, are available in the project notebook.
