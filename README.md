Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly)

Study led on a dataset of 5000 wines:

• Processing and exploration of the dataset

• Accuracy comparison of many different classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,...) before and after optimization using the GridSearchCV method

• Analysis of the results through insightful visualizations

• Theoretical research to understand the results
